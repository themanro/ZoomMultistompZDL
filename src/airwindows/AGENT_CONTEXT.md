# Airwindows Porting Context for Future Agents

The goal is not to paste desktop Airwindows code directly into a pedal build.
The goal is to make flash-safe ZDLs first, then approach the original DSP in
hardware-tested increments.

Important naming rule: if the DSP is not the Airwindows DSP, the build is an
experiment, not a port. See `docs/AIRWINDOWS-EXACT-PORTS.md`.

## Required Port Shape

Each effect directory should have:

* `manifest.json` with source parameter names/defaults/formulas.
* `build.py` that calls `write_param_header(...)` when DSP needs params.
* `<effect>.c` exporting the manifest's `audio_func_name` in `.audio`.
* A generated `*_params.h` header, ignored by git.

## DSP Safety Baseline

For first hardware tests:

* Use `.fardata: 0 bytes` whenever possible.
* Use no static delay lines, no heap, no stack arrays, no desktop math calls.
* Use no `double`, integer division/modulo, `long long`, or implicit heavy
  conversions in first probes. TI may emit RTS helpers that are not bundled.
* Prefer scalar arithmetic and fixed 16-float block assumptions.
* Keep default values dry or unity when the source plugin does that.
* Preserve `ctx[11]` / `ctx[12]` magic shuttle.
* After building, inspect linker output. A first smoke-test port should ideally
  show `.fardata: 0 bytes`, no unexpected external symbols, and no object
  relocations from DSP code.

## Compiler Rules

* Use `--mem_model:data=far`; scalar statics/globals otherwise become near
  `.bss` data accessed via `B14`.
* Avoid high `--opt_for_space` on DSP code unless you want to test the exact
  emitted helper symbols. It can introduce push/pop or call-stub RTS helpers.
* Put the audio function in `.audio` with `#pragma CODE_SECTION`.
* Generated `*_params.h` headers should be produced from the manifest so UI
  defaults and DSP fallback defaults stay in sync.

## Airwindows-Specific Trap

Many Airwindows plugins are state-heavy. `StereoChorus` has two
`int[65536]` delay buffers; reverbs and tape effects often have similar
state. Do not port those buffers into `.fardata`. For `StereoChorus`, hardware
probes have now proven enough per-instance space in `ctx[3]`; use that arena
for large state and keep `.fardata` tiny. Record the exact source parameter laws
in the manifest and document any math substitutions.

`ToTape9` is the current warning case and success case: the full `ctx[3]`
kernel builds with `.fardata: 0 bytes`, `T9InitOnly` proves lazy ctx[3] init is
safe, and the no-divide release build now loads and runs on the test MS-70CDR.
Before deepening another 9-parameter or helper-heavy port, prove the final
UI/descriptor/edit-handler shape with audio-NOP and tiny DSP builds, then add
DSP helpers only in isolated increments. For ToTape9 specifically, keep
watching parameter-default and preset lifecycle behavior.

Any beta core that is not source DSP is only for ABI probing. It must not be
described as a finished Airwindows port unless it runs the source algorithm.

See `docs/SAFE-DSP-RULES.md` and `build/ABI.md` before making a port more
ambitious. See `docs/TI-PDF-NOTES.md` for the underlying TI manual notes.
