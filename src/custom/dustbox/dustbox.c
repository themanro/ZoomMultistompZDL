/*
 * dustbox.c -- Dustbox: DOD FX33 Buzz Box clone, MS-70CDR (vacuum-cleaner
 * theme naming -- no DOD/FX33/Buzz branding).
 *
 * Pedal port of tools/audio_preview/renderers/dustbox.py. 4 knobs, left to
 * right matching the real FX33's panel order:
 *   Dust   (params[5]) - (was Heavy) blend distortion <-> sub-octave fuzz
 *                        (the ONLY knob that adds the 2-octaves-down
 *                        effect; at 0 the octave branch is fully absent)
 *   Motor  (params[6]) - (was Buzz) Grunge distortion gain / amount
 *                        (distortion ONLY, never introduces the octave
 *                        branch into the mix)
 *   Filter (params[7]) - (was Saw) tone: single high-shelf, Grunge branch
 *                        ONLY (see DB_HIGH_SHELF_*; never touches the
 *                        octave branch)
 *   Power  (params[8]) - (was Thrust) output level
 *
 * Two branches, like the original (Grunge -> Blue Box generation, then
 * parallel to the blend):
 *   [A] Grunge: pre high-pass -> gain -> asymmetric cubic soft-clip ->
 *       interstage low-pass -> second soft-clip -> Filter high-shelf.
 *   [B] Blue Box octave: fed by [A]'s DISTORTED (pre-tone) output (matching
 *       the real circuit -- Grunge feeds Blue Box), envelope follower + a
 *       loose comparator-input low-pass (not a clean pitch tracker) ->
 *       zero-crossing detector with fixed hysteresis -> /4 flip-flop
 *       divider (two software biquad-free biestables, exactly the CD4013
 *       trick) -> square gated by the envelope -> fuzz clip -> anti-alias
 *       low-pass. Runs parallel to (bypasses) the Filter tone stage: real
 *       circuit sums the octave in after the Grunge's own tone control, not
 *       through it, so Filter never colors the octave's bass.
 *       Feeding the divider harmonics instead of a clean tone is
 *       deliberate: it free-runs somewhere near-but-not-exactly two octaves
 *       down and gets progressively more unstable as Motor (gain) rises --
 *       the real circuit's "extreme/random" chainsaw chaos, not a clean
 *       tracked sub-octave. Coefficients tuned against tools/audio_preview/
 *       renderers/dustbox.py's divide-rate instrumentation harness.
 * mix = Filter(A)*(1-Dust) + B*Dust; then Power + clamp.
 *
 * Safe-DSP: no math lib (cubic soft-clip, one-pole filters with literal
 * coefficients, flip-flop octave instead of pitch tracking), no runtime
 * divide, no static arrays, no big buffer. Tiny persistent state in the
 * ctx[3] arena. ctx[11]/ctx[12] magic shuttle preserved.

 * IN the feedback loop with R9/R10/R11/C6/C7, a classic "transistor in the
 * feedback path" soft-limiter that adds gain AND its own saturation beyond
 * the plain R12/R7 ratio). This stage is completely independent of any pot
 * -- it is always driving the signal hard. Only the SECOND stage (U1B) has
 * a pot in its feedback network: P3, labelled "BUZZ (DISTORTION)" on the
 * schematic (Motor knob here), feeding diode clippers (D2/D3) at its
 * output.
 *
 * So DB_DRIVE_FIXED is a plain constant -- Motor only moves stage2. The
 * R12/R7 ratio alone is a modest ~2.2x, but that ignores Q5's added
 * nonlinear gain, which isn't a simple resistor ratio and can't be read off
 * the schematic photo precisely -- DB_DRIVE_FIXED is an ear-tuned estimate
 * of "the whole U1A stage", not a literal component-value calculation. If
 * minimum Motor still isn't hot enough on hardware, raise this first (it's
